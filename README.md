# Create Next Project

A CLI tool to create a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with the configurations I prefer.

### ‚≠ê Motivation

I had to add/remove/update same files and packages everytime I made a project which added a little friction just to start working on a project. This project aims to remove the friction, but by adding/removing/updating only required files and packages, thus keeping the project simple to start with.

> _**Note:** This will not include configurations for packages like Redux, React Query, etc. as they are project specific and should be configured separately._

### üõ†Ô∏è Included Configurations

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (updates to files)
-   [TSConfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) (with configuration for path aliases)
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (with prettier plugins)
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (optional)
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) (optional)

### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Usage

### üîß Using your own configurations

See `templates` directory for the current configurations

-   Update the file(s) for which you want to use your configuration
-   Re-install the project globally using `npm i -g` while been in the project
-   To add additional templates, add your template file and check `utils/scripts.js` where the logic for using template exist

### ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why not publish to npm?

-   Already a lot of packages/templates are available
-   It will not be customizable for everyone if they want to customize

### ü§ùüèª Contributing

_**Note:** The project is only been tested on windows as of now_

-   If you find any bugs or want to suggest updates to the template, create an [issue](https://github.com/PiyushPawar17/create-next-project/issues)
-   If you want to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/PiyushPawar17/create-next-project/pulls), avoid changes to the templates as those are based on my preferences
